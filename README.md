# Shopping-Cart
The intention of this shopping cart software is that it should be simple and as minimal as possible.
PHP shopping cart  has the following functionality: 

-> Retrieve product information from the database.
-> Create product gallery for the shopping cart.
-> Manage cart items using the PHP session.
-> Handle add, edit, remove and empty cart actions.

I have retrieved information like name, code, price, and photos from the database. The resultant information is in an array format.

I have iterated this resultant array to form the product gallery. Every product in the gallery will have an add-to-cart option.

I have used the PHP shopping cart session to store and manage the items in the cart.

Once the session expires, the cart items get cleared. This code has an option to clear the entire cart or to remove any particular item from the cart.
